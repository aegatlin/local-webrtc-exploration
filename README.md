This is a proof of concept that you can manually copy and paste SDPs and ICE candidates between local peers and have it work **without** a server intermediary for signaling. 

It works on latest chrome (as on 2023.03.03). Firefox seems to have some sort of timeout, and hasn't work there yet. I haven't tried other browsers.
